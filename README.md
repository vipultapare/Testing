<h1>What is the Difference between Bug, error, and Failure</h1>

<h2>Bug</h2>
<p>In software testing, a bug is the informal name of defects, which means that software or application is not working as per the requirement. When we have some coding error, it leads a program to its breakdown, which is known as a bug. The test engineers use the terminology Bug. If a QA (Quality Analyst) detects a bug, they can reproduce the bug and record it with the help of the bug report template.</p>

<h2>Defect</h2>
<p>When the application is not working as per the requirement is known as a defect. It is specified as the aberration from the actual and expected result of the application or software. In other words, we can say that the bug announced by the programmer and inside the code is called a Defect.</p>

<h2>Error</h2>
<p>The Problem in code leads to errors, which means that a mistake can occur due to the developer's coding error as the developer misunderstood the requirement or the requirement was not defined correctly. The developers use the term error.</p>

<h2>failure</h2>
<p>Many defects lead to the software's failure, which means that a loss specifies a fatal issue in the software/ application or in its module, which makes the system unresponsive or broken. In other words, we can say that if an end-user detects an issue in the product, then that particular issue is called a failure. Possibilities are there one defect that might lead to one failure or several failures. For example, in a bank application, if the Amount Transfer module is not working for end-users when the end-user tries to transfer money, the submit button is not working. Hence, this is a failure.</p>

<h1>Difference Between Testing and Debugging</h1>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Software testing is a process of identifying defects in the software product. It is performed to validate the behavior of the software or the application compared to requirements. In other words, we can say that the testing is a collection of techniques to determine the accuracy of the application under the predefined specification but, it cannot identify all the defects of the software. Each software or application needs to be tested before delivering to the clients and checks whether the particular software or the application is working fine as per the given requirements.</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>As opposed to Testing, Debugging is the action that the development team or a developer implements after receiving the test report related to the bugs in the software from the testing team.In the software development process, debugging includes detecting and modifying code errors in a software program.In the debugging process, the developer needs to identify the reason behind the particular bug or defect, which is carried out by analyzing the coding rigorously.The developer changes the code and then rechecks whether the defect has been deleted whenever the bug or error is found. Once the debugging is successfully finished, the application is again sent back to the test engineers, who remain in the process of testing. The debugging process allows us an earlier finding of an error and makes software development stress-free and easy.
Now, based on features and techniques of practice, we can distinguish between Testing and Debugging.</p>

<h1>HLD and LLD</h1>
<h2>HLD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>High Level Design</li>
  <li>It is the general system design, which means it signifies the overall system design.</li>
  <li>HLD is also called a System or macro-level design.</li>
  <li>Solution Architect prepares the High-Level Design.</li>
  <li>It is developed first in sequential order, which implies that the HLD is created before the LLD.</li>
  <li>It is used by management, program, and solution teams.</li>
  <li>The high-level design is necessary to understand the flow across several system objects.</li>
  <li>The input measure in high-level design is SRS (Software Requirement Specification).</li>
  <li>The output measures in the HLD are functional design, database design, and review record.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LLD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Low Level Design</li>
  <li>It is like describing high-level design, which means it signifies the procedure of the component-level design.</li>
  <li>LLD is also called details or micro-level design.</li>
  <li>Designer and developer prepare the Low-Level Design.</li>
  <li>It is developed after High-level design.</li>
  <li>It is used by designers, operation teams, and implementers.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h1>Requirement and Specification</h1>
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They plan the software from the end-user, business, and stakeholder perspectives.</li>
  <li>The requirements define what the software must do.</li>
  <li>Some of the common terminologies used for requirement document are as follows:
           SRD: System Requirement Document
           BRD: Business Requirement Document</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specification</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They prepare the software from the technical team's point of view.</li>
  <li>The specification defines how the software will be developed.</li>
  <li>Some of the common terminologies used for specification document are as follows:
FRS: Functional Requirement Specifications
SRS: System Requirement Specifications
CRS: Configurations Requirements Specification
PRS: Performance Requirements Specifications
RRS: Reliability Requirements Specifications
CRS: Compatibility Requirements Specifications
</li>
</ul>

<h1>BRS and SRS</h1>
<p>n software testing, BRS and SRS types of document requirements depend upon business type, their standards, how company processes, and what class of software is to be developed.</p>
<h2>BRS</h2>
<p>The BRS document stands for Business Requirement Specification. To create the BRS document, the Business analyst will interrelate with the customers. The BRS document includes the business rules, the project's scope, and in-detail client's requirements.In this type of document, the client describes how their business works or the software they need.</p>

<h2>SRS</h2>
<p>
The SRS document stands for Software Requirement Specification.In this document, the Business Analyst will collect the Customer Requirement Specifications (CRS) from the client and translate them into Software Requirement Specification (SRS). The SRS contains how the software should be developed and given by the Business Analyst (BA). In other words, we can say that the SRS document is used to covert the customer information into a detailed document, which can easily understand by the developers and the test engineers.The SRS document is used to determine the early cost of the software product.</p>

<h1>SDLC</h1>
<p>SDLC is a process that creates a structure of development of software. There are different phases within SDLC, and each phase has its various activities. It makes the development team able to design, create, and deliver a high-quality product.SDLC describes various phases of software development and the order of execution of phases. Each phase requires deliverable from the previous phase in a life cycle of software development. Requirements are translated into design, design into development and development into testing; after testing, it is given to the client.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requirement Phase</li>
  <li>Design Phase</li>
  <li>Build/Development Phase</li>
  <li>Testing Phase</li>
  <li>Deployment Phase</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirement Phase</h2>
<p>This is the most crucial phase of the software development life cycle for the developing team as well as for the project manager. During this phase, the client states requirements, specifications, expectations, and any other special requirement related to the product or software. All these are gathered by the business manager or project manager or analyst of the service providing company.The requirement includes how the product will be used and who will use the product to determine the load of operations. All information gathered from this phase is critical to developing the product as per the customer requirements.</p>

<h2>Design Phase</h2>
<p>The design phase includes a detailed analysis of new software according to the requirement phase. This is the high priority phase in the development life cycle of a system because the logical designing of the system is converted into physical designing. The output of the requirement phase is a collection of things that are required, and the design phase gives the way to accomplish these requirements. The decision of all required essential tools such as programming language like Java, .NET, PHP, a database like Oracle, MySQL, a combination of hardware and software to provide a platform on which software can run without any problem is taken in this phase.There are several techniques and tools, such as data flow diagrams, flowcharts, decision tables, and decision trees, Data dictionary, and the structured dictionary are used for describing the system design.</p>

<h2>Build/Development Phase</h2>
<p>After the successful completion of the requirement and design phase, the next step is to implement the design into the development of a software system. In this phase, work is divided into small units, and coding starts by the team of developers according to the design discussed in the previous phase and according to the requirements of the client discussed in requirement phase to produce the desired result.Front-end developers develop easy and attractive GUI and necessary interfaces to interact with back-end operations and back-end developers do back-end coding according to the required operations. All is done according to the procedure and guidelines demonstrated by the project manager.</p>

<h2>Testing Phase</h2>
<p>Testing is the last step of completing a software system. In this phase, after getting the developed GUI and back-end combination, it is tested against the requirements stated in the requirement phase. Testing determines whether the software is actually giving the result as per the requirements addressed in the requirement phase or not. The Development team makes a test plan to start the test. This test plan includes all types of essential testing such as integration testing, unit testing, acceptance testing, and system testing. Non-functional testing is also done in this phase.If there are any defects in the software or it is not working as per expectations, then the testing team gives information to the development team in detail about the issue. If it is a valid defect or worth to sort out, it will be fixed, and the development team replaces it with the new one, and it also needs to be verified.</p>

<h2>Deployement Phase</h2>
<p>When software testing is completed with a satisfying result, and there are no remaining issues in the working of the software, it is delivered to the customer for their use.As soon as customers receive the product, they are recommended first to do the beta testing. In beta testing, customer can require any changes which are not present in the software but mentioned in the requirement document or any other GUI changes to make it more user-friendly. Besides this, if any type of defect is encountered while a customer using the software; it will be informed to the development team of that particular software to sort out the problem. If it is a severe issue, then the development team solves it in a short time; otherwise, if it is less severe, then it will wait for the next version.After the solution of all types of bugs and changes, the software finally deployed to the end-user.</p>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>The maintenance phase is the last and long-lasting phase of SDLC because it is the process which continues until the software's life cycle comes to an end. When a customer starts using software, then actual problems start to occur, and at that time there's a need to solve these problems. This phase also includes making changes in hardware and software to maintain its operational effectiveness like to improve its performance, enhance security features and according to customer's requirements with upcoming time. This process to take care of product time to time is called maintenance.</p>

<h1>WaterFall Model</h1>
<p>It is the first approach and the basic model used in software development. It is a simple model that is easy to use as well as understand. The execution happens in the sequence order, which means that the outcome of the one-stage is equal to the input of another stage. That's why it is also known as the Linear-sequential life cycle model.To avoid the overlapping issues of the multiple phases, every stage should be completed before moving to the next stage. Each stage of the waterfall model involves the deliverable of the previous stage, like requirements, are transferred to the design phase, design moved to development, and so on. When we have the Life critical (hospital application) and Machine critical (Military project), we will widely use the waterfall model.</p>
