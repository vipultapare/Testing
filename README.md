<h1>What is the Difference between Bug, error, and Failure</h1>

<h2>Bug</h2>
<p>In software testing, a bug is the informal name of defects, which means that software or application is not working as per the requirement. When we have some coding error, it leads a program to its breakdown, which is known as a bug. The test engineers use the terminology Bug. If a QA (Quality Analyst) detects a bug, they can reproduce the bug and record it with the help of the bug report template.</p>

<h2>Defect</h2>
<p>When the application is not working as per the requirement is known as a defect. It is specified as the aberration from the actual and expected result of the application or software. In other words, we can say that the bug announced by the programmer and inside the code is called a Defect.</p>

<h2>Error</h2>
<p>The Problem in code leads to errors, which means that a mistake can occur due to the developer's coding error as the developer misunderstood the requirement or the requirement was not defined correctly. The developers use the term error.</p>

<h2>failure</h2>
<p>Many defects lead to the software's failure, which means that a loss specifies a fatal issue in the software/ application or in its module, which makes the system unresponsive or broken. In other words, we can say that if an end-user detects an issue in the product, then that particular issue is called a failure. Possibilities are there one defect that might lead to one failure or several failures. For example, in a bank application, if the Amount Transfer module is not working for end-users when the end-user tries to transfer money, the submit button is not working. Hence, this is a failure.</p>

<h1>Difference Between Testing and Debugging</h1>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Software testing is a process of identifying defects in the software product. It is performed to validate the behavior of the software or the application compared to requirements. In other words, we can say that the testing is a collection of techniques to determine the accuracy of the application under the predefined specification but, it cannot identify all the defects of the software. Each software or application needs to be tested before delivering to the clients and checks whether the particular software or the application is working fine as per the given requirements.</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>As opposed to Testing, Debugging is the action that the development team or a developer implements after receiving the test report related to the bugs in the software from the testing team.In the software development process, debugging includes detecting and modifying code errors in a software program.In the debugging process, the developer needs to identify the reason behind the particular bug or defect, which is carried out by analyzing the coding rigorously.The developer changes the code and then rechecks whether the defect has been deleted whenever the bug or error is found. Once the debugging is successfully finished, the application is again sent back to the test engineers, who remain in the process of testing. The debugging process allows us an earlier finding of an error and makes software development stress-free and easy.
Now, based on features and techniques of practice, we can distinguish between Testing and Debugging.</p>

<h1>HLD and LLD</h1>
<h2>HLD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>High Level Design</li>
  <li>It is the general system design, which means it signifies the overall system design.</li>
  <li>HLD is also called a System or macro-level design.</li>
  <li>Solution Architect prepares the High-Level Design.</li>
  <li>It is developed first in sequential order, which implies that the HLD is created before the LLD.</li>
  <li>It is used by management, program, and solution teams.</li>
  <li>The high-level design is necessary to understand the flow across several system objects.</li>
  <li>The input measure in high-level design is SRS (Software Requirement Specification).</li>
  <li>The output measures in the HLD are functional design, database design, and review record.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LLD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Low Level Design</li>
  <li>It is like describing high-level design, which means it signifies the procedure of the component-level design.</li>
  <li>LLD is also called details or micro-level design.</li>
  <li>Designer and developer prepare the Low-Level Design.</li>
  <li>It is developed after High-level design.</li>
  <li>It is used by designers, operation teams, and implementers.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h1>Requirement and Specification</h1>
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They plan the software from the end-user, business, and stakeholder perspectives.</li>
  <li>The requirements define what the software must do.</li>
  <li>Some of the common terminologies used for requirement document are as follows:
           SRD: System Requirement Document
           BRD: Business Requirement Document</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specification</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They prepare the software from the technical team's point of view.</li>
  <li>The specification defines how the software will be developed.</li>
  <li>Some of the common terminologies used for specification document are as follows:
FRS: Functional Requirement Specifications
SRS: System Requirement Specifications
CRS: Configurations Requirements Specification
PRS: Performance Requirements Specifications
RRS: Reliability Requirements Specifications
CRS: Compatibility Requirements Specifications
</li>
</ul>

<h1>BRS and SRS</h1>
<p>n software testing, BRS and SRS types of document requirements depend upon business type, their standards, how company processes, and what class of software is to be developed.</p>
<h2>BRS</h2>
<p>The BRS document stands for Business Requirement Specification. To create the BRS document, the Business analyst will interrelate with the customers. The BRS document includes the business rules, the project's scope, and in-detail client's requirements.In this type of document, the client describes how their business works or the software they need.</p>

<h2>SRS</h2>
<p>
The SRS document stands for Software Requirement Specification.In this document, the Business Analyst will collect the Customer Requirement Specifications (CRS) from the client and translate them into Software Requirement Specification (SRS). The SRS contains how the software should be developed and given by the Business Analyst (BA). In other words, we can say that the SRS document is used to covert the customer information into a detailed document, which can easily understand by the developers and the test engineers.The SRS document is used to determine the early cost of the software product.</p>
